#ROS&&Gazebo simulation Gazebo Components There are six components involved in running an instance of a Gazebo simulation: Gazebo Server Gazebo Client World Files Model Files Environment Variables Plugins
1- Gazebo Server:It is responsible for parsing the description files related to the scene we are trying to simulate"$ gzserver"

2- Gazebo Client:on the other hand provides the very essential Graphical Client that connects to the gzserver "$ gzclient"

It is a common practice to run gzserver first, followed by gzclient, allowing some time to initialize the simulation scene or run "$ gazebo"To interact with a world, model, or sensor in Gazebo, you can write plugins. These plugins can be either loaded from the command line or added to your SDF world file.

3- World Files: A world file in Gazebo contains all the elements in the simulated environment. These elements are your robot model, its environment, lighting, sensors, and other objects,usually has a ".world" extension. -The world file is formatted using the SDF(Simulation Description Format):

4- Model Files: you must create a separate SDF file of your robot with exactly the same format as your world file. This model file should only represent a single model (ex: a robot) and can be imported by your world file.

5-Environment Variables:There are many environment variables that Gazebo uses, primarily to locate files (world, model, â€¦) and set up communications between gzserver and gzclient.

6- Plugins: To interact with a world, model, or sensor in Gazebo, you can write plugins. These plugins can be either loaded from the command line or added to your SDF world file.
this repo. contain the whole projects which were achieved in the Udacity diploma that has a [ manipulator , drone , deep learning , navigation , localization , mapping ] .
the robotic arm project was KukaR210 which has 6 degree of freedom & spherical wrist the project file has the all data about the kinematics and dynamics , motion 
planning , this arm used the RGB-D sensor to detect the objects and measure the depth , this project has written in python.
